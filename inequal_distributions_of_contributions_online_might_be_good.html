<p>thinking about a <a href="http://blog.bl00cyb.org/2012/08/co-opting-and-saturation/">post of willow's</a> about the 90-9-1 distribution for online contributions.  I bet that distribution is actually a sign of health.</p>

<p>it means that each heavy contributor can manage to put in time on 99 sites that they don't heavily contribute to (making some assumptions, and saving some hands).  that's <em>good</em>.  that ensures a healthy and interesting crossover.  what might actually be a problem instead is that most people are in that 9 or 1 area on really uncompelling things.  and hence, the Internet is really uncompelling.  like, my mom is in that last ten percent on Facebook, doing shit that is largely useless for the world.  but she's still a heavy contributor somewhere!  and she lurks <em>everywhere else</em> she goes online.</p>

<p>so, my point is, a distribution like this might be a sign of health.  it also might mask other, more interesting problems.  as I mentioned before, whether the kinds of contributions people are making are interesting ones.  as well, whether interesting contributions are just not happening because of friction.  I can pretty much guarantee you that's the case.  interesting is harder than boring.</p>

<p>so, while my general point is that we need to think about this harder, my specific challenge to all my fellow hackers and whatnot who create the structure of the web, is this: let's make interesting as easy as uninteresting.</p>
